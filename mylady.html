        <h2>My Lady</h2>
        <p>The Crowd, my physical state, and my finances, all seem to be slightly off that day. I think it should be around 11’o clock to 12, or may be not. I walk along with her with great joy! And I noticed that the sandals she always wears, Man…. Those were looked particularly beautiful on her feet that day.</p>

        <p>As we were walking along, I spotted a small shop called Kumar Kulfi. We had been passing by that shop for a long time. And I had been passing by that shop for a long time. And I had always wanted to go in and have an almond milk. But that day, after seeing it, I hesitantly asked her, shall we go get an Almond Milk? She immediately said, Seri Da – Alright, Let’s go!</p>

        <p>And she walked ahead and I followed. I was Pretty sure I had no money and I doubted she had any either, but I didn’t really think about it. However, I definitely should have thought about it.</p>

<p>She isn’t very colourful, she isn’t all that fair-skinned either. When you see her wearing her saree, no one would think she’s middle class. And don’t ask me if she looks wealthy- she doesn’t give off that impression either. Perhaps upper-middle class, but I know that none of these three are truly accurate.</p>

<p>She lost her father at the age of twelve, but until that age, she had never known a lack of French Clothing, Gowns, Sandals and Cologne. And she grew up happily enjoying all of it. After her father’s passing, she lost everything; nothing was in her hands anymore. All her possessions were taken away. If I say she lost everything or had it all stripped from her, you wouldn’t be surprised and I’m sure you’ll also not be surprised that I said this.</p>

<p>However, I don’t really recall her ever really revealing that along the way. Even though its not uncommon for many women to have merged from such darkness, we tend to forget that. There ought to have been someone to explore the depths of her heart. Alright, when we got to that shop, I asked for my favourite Almond Milk and had it bought for me. She didn’t buy anything- she doesn’t like Almond milk that much. I had enough, and then I handed her the rest. I asked her if she wants something, and she said that the almond milk I gave her was more than enough for her.</p>

<p>She had a purse, it was quite large and not something she had bought. I peeked inside. And it was filled with many papers. They were in yellow, red and some other coloured chicks that you see sold on the roadside. I didn’t look at how much money there was, I don’t recall. After handing the money to the shopkeeper, we walked towards the bus stop.</p>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, since I wasn’t feeling well, I said to her, with a certain intention, a bit of discomfort, and a touch of insistence, that we should take an Auto. I’m not sure if there was enough money in the purse, but there was certainly more than enough for the Bus Fare. She just said, “Alright, Let’s take an Auto”.</p>

<p>In the distance, an auto was approaching and we waved our hand, not knowing what would happen next, she told the auto driver the name of our destination and he said, “Get in”. when I asked him how much it would cost, he have me a price – 80 rupees.</p>

<p>With a smiling face and a gentle voice along with just a slight tremble, she asked, “Would you accept 20 rupees?”. Without saying a word, the auto driver shifted gears and without pausing for even a second, gave a very sullen look and sped off as if he had slapped the door shut in a spilt second.</p>

<p>It was then that I realised that all she had with her was 20 rupees. I couldn’t bear that sense of shame and embarrassment, so I grabbed her hand and said, “Come on, Lets take the bus”. I don’t know what was she thinking, without a single wrinkle of discomfort on face, she scolded me saying, “Wait! You can’t travel by bus for that long, you’re not feeling well”. I was bit dazed, so I couldn’t respond and just stood there silently.  I looked at her- Her love and endurance struck me and I looked at the sunlight, it hit me with such intensity.</p>

<p>As we noticed an auto coming from a distance, it slowed down and stopped right next to us even before we could wave it down. I was getting ready for the discomfort and she was ready again with a smiling face, a gentle voice and just a slight tremble in her voice.</p>

<p>But before that the auto driver gave her a sort of smile, when I asked him how much would it cost? He instead asked me where we were headed. She told him, and he said, “I’m going that way anyway”. She asked him, “How much I would have to pay?”. Once again, he looked at her silently with a slight smile. And she quickly said- “Is Twenty rupees okay? I’ll give you the remaining money once I get home”.</p>

<p>Both of us got into the auto and all along the way, he kept looking at her through the rear-view mirror with a bit smile in his eyes, as if he wanted to say something. Now I watched her, and I couldn’t recall her ever looking that confused, smiling yet happy at someone before.</p>

<p>Yes…I don’t remember my mother ever looking at anyone in that way either.</p>

<p>When we got home, she asked him, “why were you smiling at me like that?”. He replied, “Mentioning/Calling her by her name… - Don’t you remember me? We studied together in fifth grade. And she said his name. And Immediately, she exclaimed, “Oh My God! Is that you?” And once again, both of them laughed and this tome I joined in as well.</p>

<p>She asked- How are you?
And he replied, 
	- I’m doing well.
	- I’ve got a son too, just like yours.
	- And my wife is pregnant again. So, I’m actually on my way to take her to the Doc.
</p>

<p>She was very pleased and said, 
	- Tell them my wishes. 
	- And, here, keep the rupees and I’ll go inside and get the rest.
He gave a gentle pat on my head and said- “It’s okay, we’ll see about it later” and off he went.
</p>

<p>By the time we got home, I felt better. She was doing her usual household chores, cooked and after a while, my father came in to eat. He brought me some treats to eat and he also got her some of her favourite sweet called Kamara Kattu. After serving him his meal, she popped that treat into her mouth and said- Hey Do you know what happened today when we were coming back from school? And do you remember the ones who studied with us at school?.....</p>
